    <h2>This is a great recipe for easy shredded chicken tacos.</h2><br>

    <h3><u>Ingredients:</u></h3>
    <ul>¼ cup water</ul>
    <ul>1 (1 ounce) packet taco seasoning mix</ul>
    <ul>2 (8 ounce) cans tomato sauce</ul>
    <ul>2 teaspoons white distilled vinegar</ul>
    <ul>2 teaspoons minced garlic</ul>
    <ul>2 teaspoons ground oregano</ul>
    <ul>1 teaspoon ground cumin</ul>
    <ul>½ teaspoon white sugar</ul>
    <ul>2 tablespoons olive oil</ul>
    <ul>2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken breasts</ul>
    <ul>8 taco shells, warmed</ul><br>

    <h3><u>Directions:</u></h3>
    <ol>
    <li>Mix water and taco seasoning in a large bowl. Add tomato sauce, vinegar, garlic, oregano, cumin, and sugar; mix well.</li><br><br>

    <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add chicken and cook until golden brown, about 5 minutes per side. Add tomato sauce mixture and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li><br><br>

    <li>Remove chicken breasts from the pan and shred meat with 2 forks when cool enough to handle. Return shredded chicken to the pan with the tomato sauce. Cook and stir until chicken is coated with sauce and sauce reduces a bit, about 5 minutes.</li><br><br>

    <li>Transfer chicken and sauce to a serving bowl and spoon onto taco shells.</li><br><br>
