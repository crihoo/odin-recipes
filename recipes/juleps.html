    <h2>Enjoy this amazing drink to get the party started or to cap the night off. Best served in a frozen silver goblet, but glasses works fine as well.</h2><br>

    <h3><u>Ingredients:</u></h3>
    <ul>2 cups water</ul>
    <ul>2 cups white sugar</ul>
    <ul>Â½ cup roughly chopped fresh mint leaves</ul>
    <ul>32 fluid ounces Kentucky bourbon</ul>
    <ul>8 sprigs fresh mint leaves for garnish</ul><br>

<h3><u>Directions:</u></h3><ol>
    <il>Combine water, sugar and chopped mint leaves in a small saucepan. Bring to a boil over high heat until the sugar is completely dissolved. Allow syrup to cool, approximately 1 hour. Pour syrup through a strainer to remove mint leaves.</il><br><br>

    <il>Fill eight cups or frozen goblets with crushed ice and pour 4 ounces of bourbon and 1/4 cup mint syrup in each. (Proportions can be adjusted depending on each person's sweet tooth). Top each cup with a mint sprig and a straw. Trim straws to just barely protrude from the top of the cups. Serve juleps on a silver platter.</il>

<h1>Enjoy!</h1>
